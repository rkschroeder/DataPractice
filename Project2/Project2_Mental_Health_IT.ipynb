The survey examines attitudes towards mental health and the prevalence of mental health disorders in the IT field. A SQLite database containing this data is [available online](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anth7310/mental-health-in-the-tech-industry/data) and will be utilized in the project. Additionally, I formulate the following questions to answer based on the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is there a relationship between gender and being diagnosed with a mental health disorder in the IT sector, based on survey data?\n",
    "2. Does age correlate with seeking professional treatment for mental health issues?\n",
    "3. Is there a connection between openess about mental health between employees from different countries?\n",
    "4. How do mental health conditions affect productivity the IT field?"

    "This project was an interesting opportunity to practice my skills in data visualization, manipulation, and analysis. However, I felt that the small number of responses from the groups I was interested in may have limited the depth of the analysis. In addition, there were some issues with the answers. For example, many responses related to the disorders were quite similar, making it challenging to define the best way to group them. The gender options included a long list, and the answers to question 3 included '1' and '0,' whereas I was expecting \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n",
