This repository contains various projects related to data analysis and data science. 
The projects span different domains such as mental health, sales data analysis, and more. 
Each project is contained in its own directory with its respective code, data, and documentation.

For each project, I created a virtual environment using Conda (via Miniconda). The library versions vary by project and are specified in the corresponding requirements.txt file.

## Project1: Motorcycle Sales Analysis

This project analyzes sales data from a motorcycle parts. It includes creating a database, data retrieving and creating visualizations
to answer business questions. 

Key files:
- `Project1/Project1_Motorcycle_Sales.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for analysis
- `Project1/sales_data.sqlite` - SQLite database containing sales data

Tools: 
- SQL, Python (matploblib, pandas,seaborn)
